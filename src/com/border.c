\brief border of a binary image

<B>Usage:</B> border in connex out

<B>Description:</B>
Let X be the subset of Zn that corresponds to the input image \b in, and 
let k be the value of the parameter \b connex (that is, 4, 8 (2d) or 6, 26 (3d)), which is the connectivity chosen for X.

The border B(X) of X is defined by:
B(X) = {x in X, (Gamma_nk(x) inter Xbar) not empty}
where nk is the complementary connectivity for k.

<B>Types supported:</B> byte 2d, byte 3d

<B>Category:</B> topobin
\ingroup  topobin
