\brief Euclidean binary skeleton

<B>Usage:</B> skeleucl in.pgm connex [inhibit] out.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Eclidean binary skeleton.

The parameter \b connex indicates the connectivity of the binary object.
Possible choices are 4, 8 in 2d and 6, 26 in 3d.

If the parameter \b inhibit is given and is a binary image name,
then the points of this image will be left unchanged.
