\brief detects extensible points in a grayscale image

<B>Usage:</B> ptextensible im.pgm <imcond.pgm|null> connex fileout.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Extensible point detection.
The input image \b im.pgm must be a "thin" grayscale image, as
the output of the operator \b hthin.
The parameter \b connex indicates the cconnectivity used for the minimal 
regions.
The optional parameter \b imcond.pgm is a binary image which indicates the points
in the neighborhood of which the extensible points will be searched.
