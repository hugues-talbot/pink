\brief parallel 3D binary curvilinear skeleton based on 1D isthmuses

<B>Usage:</B> skel_CK3p in.pgm pers [inhibit] out.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Parallel 3D binary thinning or curvilinear skeleton based on 1D isthmuses, 
with a persistence parameter: \b pers.

If the parameter \b inhibit is given and is a binary image name,
then the points of this image will be left unchanged. 

<B>Warning:</B> The object must not have any point on the frame of the image.

<B>Types supported:</B> byte 3d

<B>Category:</B> topobin
\ingroup  topobin
