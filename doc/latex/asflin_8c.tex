\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter by linear structuring elements 

{\bf Usage:} asflin in.pgm $<$x$|$y$|$z$>$ [rmin] rmax out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Alternate sequential filter by linear structuring elements for grayscale images. Linear structuring elements in direction {\bf x, y} or {\bf z} of increasing radius, ranging from 1 (or {\bf rmin} if this parameter is specified) to {\bf rmax}, are generated. Let D1...Dn be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let I0 = {\bf in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result Ii is obtained by the closing of the opening of Ii-1 by the structuring element Di. The result {\bf out.pgm} contains the final result In. Giving a value 0 for the optional parameter {\bf rmin} has the effect of beginning by a closing instead of an opening.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bf Category:} morpho
