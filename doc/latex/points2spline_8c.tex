converts a sequence of control points into a spline 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
converts a sequence of control points into a spline 

{\bf Usage:} points2spline points.txt spline.txt

{\bf Description:}

Let S be the sequence of control points in {\bf points.txt}. This program computes a parametric curve P defined by two (in 2D) or three (in 3D) splines that interpolates the points of the sequence S.

If the last point equals the first point, then a closed spline is generated.

The result is given in the form of the list of control points, followed by the set of coefficients for each spline segment.

The input file {\bf points.txt} contains a list of points under the format:

b nbpoints\par
 x1 y1\par
 x2 y2\par
 x3 y3\par
 ...\par


or:

B nbpoints\par
 x1 y1 z1\par
 x2 y2 z2\par
 x3 y3 z3\par
 ...\par


The output file format is the following for 2D:

c n+1 (where n+1 denotes the number of control points)\par
 x1 y1\par
 ...\par
 xn+1 yn+1\par
 C0X1 C0Y1 C1X1 C1Y1 C2X1 C2Y1 C3X1 C3Y1\par
 ...\par
 C0Xn C0Yn C1Xn C1Yn C2Xn C2Yn C3Xn C3Yn\par


and in the 3D case:

C n+1 (where n+1 denotes the number of control points)\par
 x1 y1 z1\par
 ...\par
 xn+1 yn+1 zn+1\par
 C0X1 C0Y1 C0Z1 C1X1 C1Y1 C1Z1 C2X1 C2Y1 C2Z1 C3X1 C3Y1 C3Z1\par
 ...\par
 C0Xn C0Yn C0Zn C1Xn C1Yn C1Zn C2Xn C2Yn C2Zn C3Xn C3Yn C3Zn\par


The ith segment of the parametric curve P is then defined by:

x(t) = C3Xi $\ast$ t$^\wedge$3 + C2Xi $\ast$ t$^\wedge$2 + C1Xi $\ast$ t + C0Xi\par
 y(t) = C3Yi $\ast$ t$^\wedge$3 + C2Yi $\ast$ t$^\wedge$2 + C1Yi $\ast$ t + C0Yi\par
 z(t) = C3Zi $\ast$ t$^\wedge$3 + C2Zi $\ast$ t$^\wedge$2 + C1Zi $\ast$ t + C0Zi\par
 with t in [0,1]
