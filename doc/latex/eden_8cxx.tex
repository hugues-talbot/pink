growth and/or shrinking of an 2D binary image - Eden process 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
growth and/or shrinking of an 2D binary image - Eden process 

{\bf Usage:} eden in.pgm niter grow shrink topo out.pgm

{\bf Description:}

Algorithm is as follows.

For growth: \begin{itemize}
\item start from known set \item take pixels from the border into a queue \item choose randomly one such pixel \item set it to 1 \item update queues \item repeat\end{itemize}
For shrinking: \begin{itemize}
\item same thing but set to 0\end{itemize}
For adding boundary noise \begin{itemize}
\item alternate growth and shrinking\end{itemize}
With topological constraints \begin{itemize}
\item make sure the point to add or remove is simple\end{itemize}
Parameters: \begin{itemize}
\item niter (positive integer): number of iterations \item grow (1/0): perform growing or not \item shrink (1/0): perform shrinking or not \item topo (26/6/8/4/0): connectivity for the object - 0: no topological constraint\end{itemize}
{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bf Category:} geo
