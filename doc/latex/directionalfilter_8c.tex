directional filter for curvilinear feature extraction  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
directional filter for curvilinear feature extraction {\bfseries Usage:} \doxyref{directionalfilter.c}{p.}{directionalfilter_8c} in.pgm width length ndir out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Let F be the original image from {\bfseries in.pgm} . This operator computes the supremum of the convolutions of F by a series of kernels K0, ... Kn where n = {\bfseries ndir} -\/ 1, which are defined by, for each (x,y) and each i in [0...n]:

\begin{DoxyVerb}
sigma = 1 / (2*width*width);
lambda = 1 / (2*length*length);
theta = i * PI / n;
xr = cos(theta) * x - sin(theta) * y;
yr = sin(theta) * x + cos(theta) * y;
Ki(x,y) = exp(-lambda*yr*yr) *
          (4*sigma*sigma*xr*xr - 2*sigma) * 
          exp(-sigma*xr*xr) 
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, int32\_\-t 2d, float 2d

{\bfseries Category:} signal
