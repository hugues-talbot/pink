parallel 3D binary curvilinear skeleton based on ends  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
parallel 3D binary curvilinear skeleton based on ends {\bfseries Usage:} skel\_\-EK3 in.pgm nsteps [inhibit] out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Parallel 3D binary thinning or curvilinear skeleton based on ends. The parameter {\bfseries nsteps} gives, if positive, the number of parallel thinning steps to be processed. If the value given for {\bfseries nsteps} equals -\/1, the thinning is continued until stability.

If the parameter {\bfseries inhibit} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image will be left unchanged.

{\bfseries Warning:} The object must not have any point on the frame of the image.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} topobin
