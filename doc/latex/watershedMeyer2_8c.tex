watershed transformation (Meyer's algorithm) with labelled markers  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
watershed transformation (Meyer's algorithm) with labelled markers {\bfseries Usage:} watershedMeyer2 in mark $<$roi$|$null$>$ connex out

{\bfseries Description:} Performs the watershed transformation on the image {\bfseries in}, taking the set of markers in {\bfseries mark}, in the form of a label image where all the pixels sharing the same label (even if not connected) belong to the same marker. If this parameter is present, {\bfseries roi} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. The parameter {\bfseries connex} gives the adjacency relation (4,8 in 2D; 6,18,26 in 3D) for the makers.

The result is a label image.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} connect
