distance transform (internal)  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
distance transform (internal) {\bfseries Usage:} distc in.pgm mode out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Distance to the complementary of the object X defined by the binary image {\bfseries in.pgm} . The result function DX(x) is defined by: DX(x) = min \{d(x,y), y not in X\}.

The distance d used depends on the parameter {\bfseries mode} : \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0: approximate euclidean distance (truncated) \item 1: approximate quadratic euclidean distance \item 2: chamfer distance \item 3: exact quadratic euclidean distance \item 4: 4-\/distance in 2d \item 5: exact euclidean distance (float) \item 8: 8-\/distance in 2d \item 6: 6-\/distance in 3d \item 18: 18-\/distance in 3d \item 26: 26-\/distance in 3d \item 40: 4-\/distance in 2d (byte coded ouput) \item 80: 8-\/distance in 2d (byte coded ouput) \item 60: 6-\/distance in 3d (byte coded ouput) \item 180: 18-\/distance in 3d (byte coded ouput) \item 260: 26-\/distance in 3d (byte coded ouput)\end{DoxyItemize}
The output {\bfseries out.pgm} is of type int32\_\-t for modes $<$ 40, of type byte for other modes.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} morpho
