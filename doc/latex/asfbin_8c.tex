\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter for binary images 

{\bf Usage:} asfbin in.pgm [rmin] rmax out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Alternate sequential filter for binary images.

Disc-shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 (or {\bf rmin} if this parameter is specified) to {\bf rmax}, are generated.

Let D$_{\mbox{1}}$ ...D$_{\mbox{n}}$  be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let F$_{\mbox{0}}$  = {\bf in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result F$_{\mbox{i}}$  is obtained by the closing of the opening of F$_{\mbox{i-1}}$  by the structuring element D$_{\mbox{i}}$ . The result {\bf out.pgm} contains the final result F$_{\mbox{n}}$ . Giving a value 0 for the optional parameter {\bf rmin} has the effect of beginning by a closing instead of an opening.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bf Category:} morpho
