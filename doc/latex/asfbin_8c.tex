alternate sequential filter for binary images  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter for binary images {\bfseries Usage:} asfbin in.pgm [rmin] rmax out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Alternate sequential filter for binary images.

Disc-\/shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 (or {\bfseries rmin} if this parameter is specified) to {\bfseries rmax}, are generated.

Let D$_{\mbox{1}}$ ...D$_{\mbox{n}}$  be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let F$_{\mbox{0}}$  = {\bfseries in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result F$_{\mbox{i}}$  is obtained by the closing of the opening of F$_{\mbox{i-\/1}}$  by the structuring element D$_{\mbox{i}}$ . The result {\bfseries out.pgm} contains the final result F$_{\mbox{n}}$ . Giving a value 0 for the optional parameter {\bfseries rmin} has the effect of beginning by a closing instead of an opening.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} morpho
