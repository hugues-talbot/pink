radial rank-\/max opening by line  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
radial rank-\/max opening by line {\bfseries Usage:} radialrankmaxopening in.pgm length rank [angle in degrees] [dilatmask.pgm] out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Radial rank-\/max opening by line (or dilated line). Max between the rank-\/max openings (with parameter {\bfseries rank}) of {\bfseries in.pgm} by a linear structuring element rotated by angle until 360 degrees and dilated by dilatmask.pgm. The angle is normalized to an exact division of 360 by an integer.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bfseries Category:} morpho
