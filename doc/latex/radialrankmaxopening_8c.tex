radial rank-max opening by line 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
radial rank-max opening by line 

{\bf Usage:} radialrankmaxopening in.pgm length rank [angle in degrees] [dilatmask.pgm] out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Radial rank-max opening by line (or dilated line). Max between the rank-max openings (with parameter {\bf rank}) of {\bf in.pgm} by a linear structuring element rotated by angle until 360 degrees and dilated by dilatmask.pgm. The angle is normalized to an exact division of 360 by an integer.
