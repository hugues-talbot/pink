\subsection{Detailed Description}

{\bf Usage:} watershed in mark $<$bgmark$|$null$>$ $<$roi$|$null$>$ out

{\bf Description:} Performs the watershed transformation on the image {\bf in.pgm}, taking the set of markers in {\bf mark.pgm}. If this parameter is present, {\bf bgmark.pgm} is used as a set of markers for the background. If this parameter is present, {\bf roi} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. All images must be previously transformed in the khalimsky space with a max strategy. The output image is in khalimsky space too.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bf Category:} connect orders
