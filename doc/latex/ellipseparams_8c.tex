\subsection{Detailed Description}
ellipse identification and main parameter computation 

{\bf Usage:} ellipseparams pts.list out.list

{\bf Description:} Identifies the ellipse E which minimizes the sum of the (approximate) distances between the points in {\bf pts.list} and E. The output is a list containing 6 numbers: a1, a2, r1, r2, r3, r4 where a1 is the half of the big axis length, a2 is the the half of the little axis length, and each ri is the mean \char`\"{}distance\char`\"{}, for quadrant i, between intput points and the computed ellipse (the expected value for points forming a perfect ellipse is 0)
