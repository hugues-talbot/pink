\subsection{Detailed Description}
generates intermediate scenes by interpolation 

{\bf Usage:} animscenes prefix\_\-in begin end prefix\_\-out nbsamples

{\bf Description:} The input scenes must be stored in files with names of the form {\bf prefix\_\-inXXXX.3sc}, where XXXX is an integer between {\bf begin} and {\bf end}. They must all contain the same number of objects, and object types must match from one scene to each other (order matters).

Between the scenes of the series, a total number of {\bf nbsamples} scenes are generated by spline interpolation.

{\bf Types supported:} scene 3D
