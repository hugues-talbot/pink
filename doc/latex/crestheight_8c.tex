measures the height of crests in a thinned grayscale image 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
measures the height of crests in a thinned grayscale image 

{\bf Usage:} crestheight skel.pgm connex out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Let F be the input image (parameter {\bf skel.pgm}), and let R be the output image (parameter {\bf out.pgm}). For each point p which is separating for F (connexity given by the parameter {\bf connex}), the output value R(p) is equal to calpha8m(F,S,p).
