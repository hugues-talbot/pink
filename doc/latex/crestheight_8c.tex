measures the height of crests in a thinned grayscale image  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
measures the height of crests in a thinned grayscale image {\bfseries Usage:} crestheight skel.pgm connex out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Let F be the input image (parameter {\bfseries skel.pgm}), and let R be the output image (parameter {\bfseries out.pgm}). For each point p which is separating for F (connexity given by the parameter {\bfseries connex}), the output value R(p) is equal to calpha8m(F,S,p).
