granulometry of a binary image  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
granulometry of a binary image {\bfseries Usage:} granulometry in.pgm [rmin] rmax out.list

{\bfseries Description:} Let X be the set of non-\/null points in {\bfseries in.pgm}. This operator computes the area (volume in 3d) of the opening of X by euclidean balls of increasing radius, ranging from 1 (or {\bfseries rmin} if this parameter is specified) to {\bfseries rmax}. The result {\bfseries out.list} contains a list of couples {\bfseries r a} where {\bfseries r} is a radius and {\bfseries a} is the corresponding area (or volume).

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} morpho
