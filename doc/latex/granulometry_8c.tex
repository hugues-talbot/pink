\subsection{Detailed Description}
granulometry of a binary image 

{\bf Usage:} granulometry in.pgm [rmin] rmax out.list

{\bf Description:} Let X be the set of non-null points in {\bf in.pgm}. This operator computes the area (volume in 3d) of the opening of X by euclidean balls of increasing radius, ranging from 1 (or {\bf rmin} if this parameter is specified) to {\bf rmax}. The result {\bf out.list} contains a list of couples {\bf r a} where {\bf r} is a radius and {\bf a} is the corresponding area (or volume).

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bf Category:} morpho
