ultimate constrained collapse guided by a priority image  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
ultimate constrained collapse guided by a priority image {\bfseries Usage:} 2dcollapse in.pgm prio [inhibit] out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Ultimate constrained collapse guided by a priority image. The lowest values of the priority image correspond to the highest priority.

The parameter {\bfseries prio} is either an image (byte or int32\_\-t), or a numerical code indicating that a distance map will be used as a priority image; the possible choices are: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0: approximate euclidean distance \item 1: approximate quadratic euclidean distance \item 2: chamfer distance \item 3: exact quadratic euclidean distance \item 4: 4-\/distance in 2d \item 8: 8-\/distance in 2d\end{DoxyItemize}
If the parameter {\bfseries inhibit} is given and is a binary image name, then the elements of this image will be left unchanged. If the parameter {\bfseries inhibit} is given and is a number I, then the elements with priority greater than or equal to I will be left unchanged.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
The result makes sense only if the input image is a complex.
\end{DoxyWarning}
{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bfseries Category:} orders
