{\bf Description:} Let X be the subset of Zn that corresponds to the input image {\bf in}, and let k be the value of the parameter {\bf connex} (that is, 4, 8 (2d) or 6, 26 (3d)), which is the connectivity chosen for X.

The border B(X) of X is defined by: B(X) = \{x in X, (Gamma\_\-nk(x) inter Xbar) not empty\} where nk is the complementary connectivity for k.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d
