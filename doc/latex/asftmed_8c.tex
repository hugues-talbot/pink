alternate sequential filter controled by topology  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter controled by topology {\bfseries Usage:} asftmed in.pgm connex rmax out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Alternate sequential filter controled by topology (see [CB04]). Disc-\/ or Ball-\/shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 to {\bfseries rmax}, are generated. Let D1...Dn be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let I(0) = {\bfseries in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result I(i) is obtained by the homotopic pseudo-\/closing of the homotopic pseudo-\/opening of I(i-\/1) by the structuring element Di. Furthermore, the medial axes (distance 8 in 2D, 26 in 3D) of both the input image and its inverse are used as constraint sets. The result {\bfseries out.pgm} contains the final result I(n).
