\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter controled by topology 

{\bf Usage:} asftmed in.pgm connex rmax out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Alternate sequential filter controled by topology (see [CB04]). Disc- or Ball-shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 to {\bf rmax}, are generated. Let D1...Dn be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let I(0) = {\bf in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result I(i) is obtained by the homotopic pseudo-closing of the homotopic pseudo-opening of I(i-1) by the structuring element Di. Furthermore, the medial axes (distance 8 in 2D, 26 in 3D) of both the input image and its inverse are used as constraint sets. The result {\bf out.pgm} contains the final result I(n).
