{\bf Usage:} graph2pgm in.graph $<$in.pgm$|$rs cs ds$>$ out.pgm

{\bf Description:}

Reads the file {\bf in.graph}. Each vertex of this graph must have integer coordinates, and represents a pixel/voxel of a 2D/3D image. If a file name {\bf in.pgm} is given, then the points read in {\bf in.graph} are inserted (if possible) into the image read in {\bf in.pgm}. Else, they are inserted in a new image, the dimensions of which are {\bf rs}, {\bf cs}, and {\bf ds}.

{\bf Types supported:} graph
