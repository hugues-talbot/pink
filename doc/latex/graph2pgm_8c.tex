{\bfseries Description:}

Reads the file {\bfseries in.graph}. Each vertex of this graph must have integer coordinates, and represents a pixel/voxel of a 2D/3D image. If a file name {\bfseries in.pgm} is given, then the points read in {\bfseries in.graph} are inserted (if possible) into the image read in {\bfseries in.pgm}. Else, they are inserted in a new image, the dimensions of which are {\bfseries rs}, {\bfseries cs}, and {\bfseries ds}.
