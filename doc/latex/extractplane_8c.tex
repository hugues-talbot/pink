\subsection{Detailed Description}
extracts a plane normal to one of the directions x,y,z from a 3D image 

{\bf Usage:} extractplane in.pgm n plane out.pgm

{\bf Description:} The original 3D image is {\bf in.pgm}. The parameter {\bf n} is an integer. The parameter {\bf plane} is set to {\bf xy}, {\bf yx}, {\bf xz}, {\bf zx}, {\bf yz}, {\bf zy}. The order of the letters x, y, z is meaningfull: for example, zy means that each row of the output image will correspond to a z-line of the original image, each column of the output image will correspond to a y-line of the original image. The output image {\bf out.pgm} contains the {\bf n}th plane of the given form extracted from {\bf in.pgm}.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bf Category:} geo
