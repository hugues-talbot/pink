extracts a plane normal to one of the directions x,y,z from a 3D image  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
extracts a plane normal to one of the directions x,y,z from a 3D image {\bfseries Usage:} extractplane in.pgm n plane out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} The original 3D image is {\bfseries in.pgm}. The parameter {\bfseries n} is an integer. The parameter {\bfseries plane} is set to {\bfseries xy}, {\bfseries yx}, {\bfseries xz}, {\bfseries zx}, {\bfseries yz}, {\bfseries zy}. The order of the letters x, y, z is meaningfull: for example, zy means that each row of the output image will correspond to a z-\/line of the original image, each column of the output image will correspond to a y-\/line of the original image. The output image {\bfseries out.pgm} contains the {\bfseries n}th plane of the given form extracted from {\bfseries in.pgm}.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} geo
