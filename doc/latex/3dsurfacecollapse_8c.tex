parallel directional constrained collapse with surface detection and preservation 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
parallel directional constrained collapse with surface detection and preservation 

{\bf Usage:} 3dsurfacecollapse in.pgm mode nsteps [inhibit] out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Parallel directional constrained collapse with surface detection and preservation.

The parameter {\bf mode} selects the strategy used to detect surface elements. The possible choices are: \begin{itemize}
\item 1: any 2-dimensional facet\end{itemize}
The parameter {\bf nsteps} gives the number of \char`\"{}layers\char`\"{} to be removes, if the value is -1 then the interations continue until stability.

If the parameter {\bf inhibit} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image will be left unchanged.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bf Category:} orders
