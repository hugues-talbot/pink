parallel directional constrained collapse with surface detection and preservation  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
parallel directional constrained collapse with surface detection and preservation {\bfseries Usage:} 3dsurfacecollapse in.pgm mode nsteps [inhibit] out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Parallel directional constrained collapse with surface detection and preservation.

The parameter {\bfseries mode} selects the strategy used to detect surface elements. The possible choices are: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 1: any 2-\/dimensional facet\end{DoxyItemize}
The parameter {\bfseries nsteps} gives the number of \char`\"{}layers\char`\"{} to be removes, if the value is -\/1 then the interations continue until stability.

If the parameter {\bfseries inhibit} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image will be left unchanged.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} orders
