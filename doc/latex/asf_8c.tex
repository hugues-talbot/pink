alternate sequential filter  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter {\bfseries Usage:} asf in.pgm [rmin] rmax out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Alternate sequential filter for grayscale images (for binary images use preferably asfbin). Disc-\/shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 (or {\bfseries rmin} if this parameter is specified) to {\bfseries rmax}, are generated. Let D1...Dn be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let I0 = {\bfseries in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result Ii is obtained by the closing of the opening of Ii-\/1 by the structuring element Di. The result {\bfseries out.pgm} contains the final result In. Giving a value 0 for the optional parameter {\bfseries rmin} has the effect of beginning by a closing instead of an opening.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} morpho
