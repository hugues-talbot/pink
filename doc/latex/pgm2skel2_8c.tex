decomposition of a curvilinear skeleton into isolated points, end points, curves and junctions  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
decomposition of a curvilinear skeleton into isolated points, end points, curves and junctions {\bfseries Usage:} pgm2skel in.pgm junc.pgm connex out.skel

{\bfseries Description:} The skeleton found in {\bfseries in.pgm} is decomposed into isolated points, end points, curves and junctions ; and its description is stored in {\bfseries out.skel} . The parameter {\bfseries connex} sets the adjacency relation used for the object (4, 8 (2d) or 6, 18, 26 (3d)).

The image given as parameter{\bfseries junc.pgm} contains curve points that will artificially considered as junction points.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Points at the border of the image will be ignored.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION: different junctions in the original image must not be in direct contact with each other (i.e., connected) otherwise they will be considered as a single junction. To prevent this to occur, one can increase image resolution.
\end{DoxyWarning}
{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} topobin
