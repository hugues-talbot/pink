\subsection{Detailed Description}
zoom (shrink or expand) an image 

{\bf Usage:} zoom in.pgm $<$f $|$ x rs $|$ y cs $|$ z ds $|$ fx fy fz$>$ out.pgm

{\bf Description:} There are 3 modes, depending on the number of arguments.

1 argument: the same scale factor {\bf f} is applied to both dimensions x and y (and z in 3D)

2 arguments: if the parameter {\bf x} is used, followed by an integer number {\bf rs}, the zoom factor {\bf f} is computed by dividing {\bf rs} by the rowsize of {\bf in.pgm}. If the parameter {\bf y} is used, followed by an integer number {\bf cs}, {\bf f} is computed by dividing {\bf cs} by the colsize of {\bf in.pgm}. If the parameter {\bf z} is used, followed by an integer number {\bf ds}, {\bf f} is computed by dividing {\bf ds} by the depth of {\bf in.pgm}.

3 arguments: different zoom factors {\bf fx}, {\bf fy}, {\bf fz} are given for directions x, y, z.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 1d, byte 2d, byte 3d, int32\_\-t 2d, int32\_\-t 3d, float 2d, float 3d

{\bf Category:} geo
