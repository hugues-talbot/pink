finds a shortest path from x to y in image  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
finds a shortest path from x to y in image {\bfseries Usage:} shortestpath in.pgm connex mode S1 S2 [S3] D1 D2 [D3] out.lst

{\bfseries Description:} A weighted graph G = (V,E) is defined with V = set of pixels of {\bfseries in.pgm} and E = \{(P,Q) in VxV ; P and Q are {\bfseries connex-\/} adjacent\}. Let F(P) be the value of pixel P in the image {\bfseries in.pgm}. A weight W(P,Q) is assigned to each edge, according to the value of {\bfseries mode:} 

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item max : W(P,Q) = max\{F(P),F(Q)\} \item min : W(P,Q) = min\{F(P),F(Q)\} \item avg : W(P,Q) = (F(P) + F(Q)) / 2\end{DoxyItemize}
This operator finds a shortest path from ({\bfseries S1}, {\bfseries S2}) to ({\bfseries D1}, {\bfseries D2}) in this graph. The result is given as a list of vertices (pixels) in {\bfseries out.lst}.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2D, byte 3D

{\bfseries Category:} connect
