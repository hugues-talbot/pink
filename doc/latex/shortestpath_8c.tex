finds a shortest path from x to y in image 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
finds a shortest path from x to y in image 

{\bf Usage:} shortestpath in.pgm connex mode S1 S2 [S3] D1 D2 [D3] out.lst

{\bf Description:} A weighted graph G = (V,E) is defined with V = set of pixels of {\bf in.pgm} and E = \{(P,Q) in Vx\-V ; P and Q are {\bf connex-} adjacent\}. Let F(P) be the value of pixel P in the image {\bf in.pgm}. A weight W(P,Q) is assigned to each edge, according to the value of {\bf mode:} 

\begin{itemize}
\item max : W(P,Q) = max\{F(P),F(Q)\} \item min : W(P,Q) = min\{F(P),F(Q)\} \item avg : W(P,Q) = (F(P) + F(Q)) / 2\end{itemize}
This operator finds a shortest path from ({\bf S1}, {\bf S2}) to ({\bf D1}, {\bf D2}) in this graph. The result is given as a list of vertices (pixels) in {\bf out.lst}.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2D, byte 3D

{\bf Category:} connect
