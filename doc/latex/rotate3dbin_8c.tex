rotation of an image  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
rotation of an image {\bfseries Usage:} rotate3dbin in.pgm theta axis [c1 c2] out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Method: truncated real rotation. Rotates the image {\bfseries in.pgm} of the angle {\bfseries theta} (in degrees), around the straight line defined by parameters {\bfseries axis}, {\bfseries c1} and {\bfseries c2}, parallel to one of the main axes x, y, z.\par
 Parameter {\bfseries axis} may be either x, y or z.\par
 If {\bfseries axis} = x, then the rotation axis is defined by y = {\bfseries c1}, z = {\bfseries c2}.\par
 If {\bfseries axis} = y, then the rotation axis is defined by x = {\bfseries c1}, z = {\bfseries c2}.\par
 If {\bfseries axis} = z, then the rotation axis is defined by x = {\bfseries c1}, y = {\bfseries c2}.\par


If {\bfseries in.pgm} is not a structuring element, and if parameters {\bfseries c1} and {\bfseries c2} are omitted then the default values 0, 0 are assumed and the resulting image size is computed such that no loss of information occur. Otherwise, no resize is made.

If {\bfseries in.pgm} is a structuring element, then parameters {\bfseries c1} and {\bfseries c2} are ignored and the coordinates of the rotation axis are taken among the ones of the origin of the structuring element.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} geo
