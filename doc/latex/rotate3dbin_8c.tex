rotation of an image 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
rotation of an image 

{\bf Usage:} rotate3dbin in.pgm theta axis [c1 c2] out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Method: truncated real rotation. Rotates the image {\bf in.pgm} of the angle {\bf theta} (in degrees), around the straight line defined by parameters {\bf axis}, {\bf c1} and {\bf c2}, parallel to one of the main axes x, y, z.\par
 Parameter {\bf axis} may be either x, y or z.\par
 If {\bf axis} = x, then the rotation axis is defined by y = {\bf c1}, z = {\bf c2}.\par
 If {\bf axis} = y, then the rotation axis is defined by x = {\bf c1}, z = {\bf c2}.\par
 If {\bf axis} = z, then the rotation axis is defined by x = {\bf c1}, y = {\bf c2}.\par


If {\bf in.pgm} is not a structuring element, and if parameters {\bf c1} and {\bf c2} are omitted then the default values 0, 0 are assumed and the resulting image size is computed such that no loss of information occur. Otherwise, no resize is made.

If {\bf in.pgm} is a structuring element, then parameters {\bf c1} and {\bf c2} are ignored and the coordinates of the rotation axis are taken among the ones of the origin of the structuring element.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bf Category:} geo
