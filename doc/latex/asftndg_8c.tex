alternate sequential filter controled by topology  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter controled by topology {\bfseries Usage:} asftndg in.pgm $<$c.pgm cc.pgm$|$null null$>$ connex rmax out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Alternate sequential filter controled by topology for multilevel images. Disc-\/ or Ball-\/shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 to {\bfseries rmax}, are generated. Let D1...Dn be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let I(0) = {\bfseries in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result I(i) is obtained by the homotopic pseudo-\/closing of the homotopic pseudo-\/opening of I(i-\/1) by the structuring element Di. Two images {\bfseries c.pgm} and {\bfseries cc.pgm} can be given to serve as constraints. The image {\bfseries c.pgm} must be 0 except for the points x that are to be preserved, which can be set to 255 or to I[x]. The image {\bfseries cc.pgm} must be 255 except for the points x that are to be preserved, which can be set to 0 or to I[x]. The result {\bfseries out.pgm} contains the final result I(n).

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} morpho, topogray ,
