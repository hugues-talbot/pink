\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter controled by topology 

{\bf Usage:} asftndg in.pgm $<$c.pgm cc.pgm$|$null null$>$ connex rmax out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Alternate sequential filter controled by topology for multilevel images. Disc- or Ball-shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 to {\bf rmax}, are generated. Let D1...Dn be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let I(0) = {\bf in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result I(i) is obtained by the homotopic pseudo-closing of the homotopic pseudo-opening of I(i-1) by the structuring element Di. Two images {\bf c.pgm} and {\bf cc.pgm} can be given to serve as constraints. The image {\bf c.pgm} must be 0 except for the points x that are to be preserved, which can be set to 255 or to I[x]. The image {\bf cc.pgm} must be 255 except for the points x that are to be preserved, which can be set to 0 or to I[x]. The result {\bf out.pgm} contains the final result I(n).

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bf Category:} morpho, topogray ,
