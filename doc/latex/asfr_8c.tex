alternate sequential filter by reconstruction 

{\bf Usage:} asfr in.pgm [rmin] rmax out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Alternate sequential filter by reconstruction. Disc-shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 (or {\bf rmin} if this parameter is specified) to {\bf rmax}, are generated. Let D1...Dn be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let I0 = {\bf in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result Ii is obtained by the closure by reconstruction of Ii-1 by the structuring element Di. The result {\bf out.pgm} contains the final result In.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bf Category:} morpho
