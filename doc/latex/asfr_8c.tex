alternate sequential filter by reconstruction  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
alternate sequential filter by reconstruction {\bfseries Usage:} asfr in.pgm [rmin] rmax out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Alternate sequential filter by reconstruction. Disc-\/shaped structuring elements of increasing radius, ranging from 1 (or {\bfseries rmin} if this parameter is specified) to {\bfseries rmax}, are generated. Let D1...Dn be these structuring elements, sorted by increasing radius. Let I0 = {\bfseries in.pgm}, the ith intermediate result Ii is obtained by the closure by reconstruction of Ii-\/1 by the structuring element Di. The result {\bfseries out.pgm} contains the final result In.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bfseries Category:} morpho
