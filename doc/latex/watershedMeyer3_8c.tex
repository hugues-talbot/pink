watershed transformation (Meyer's algorithm) with labelled markers and without separation lines 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
watershed transformation (Meyer's algorithm) with labelled markers and without separation lines 

{\bf Usage:} watershed\-Meyer3 in mark $<$roi$|$null$>$ connex out

{\bf Description:} Performs the watershed transformation without separation lines, on the image {\bf in}, taking the set of markers in {\bf mark}, in the form of a label image where all the pixels sharing the same label (even if not connected) belong to the same marker. If this parameter is present, {\bf roi} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. The parameter {\bf connex} gives the adjacency relation (4,8 in 2D; 6,18,26 in 3D) for the makers.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bf Category:} connect
