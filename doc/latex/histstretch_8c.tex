transforms the gray scale by stretching the histogram 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
transforms the gray scale by stretching the histogram 

{\bf Usage:} histstretch in.pgm vmin vmax p out.pgm

{\bf Description:}

Eliminates the levels of the histogram strictly less than {\bf vmin} or strictly greater than {\bf vmax}, and also the extremal levels that have strictly less than N$\ast$({\bf p}/100) pixels (N being the total number of pixels). If {\bf p} = 0, only the extremal levels with 0 pixels are eliminated. A linear histogram scaling is then performed.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2D

{\bf Category:} histo
