transforms the gray scale by stretching the histogram  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
transforms the gray scale by stretching the histogram {\bfseries Usage:} histstretch in.pgm vmin vmax p out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:}

Eliminates the levels of the histogram strictly less than {\bfseries vmin} or strictly greater than {\bfseries vmax}, and also the extremal levels that have strictly less than N$\ast$({\bfseries p}/100) pixels (N being the total number of pixels). If {\bfseries p} = 0, only the extremal levels with 0 pixels are eliminated. A linear histogram scaling is then performed.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2D

{\bfseries Category:} histo
