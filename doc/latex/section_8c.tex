computes a 2d cross section from a 3d image 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
computes a 2d cross section from a 3d image 

{\bf Usage:} section in.pgm x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 out.pgm

{\bf Description:} The points P0 ( {\bf x0}, {\bf y0}, {\bf z0} ), P1 ( {\bf x1}, {\bf y1}, {\bf z1} ) and P2 ( {\bf x2}, {\bf y2}, {\bf z2} ) form a basis for a plane in the 3d space. The intersection of this plane with the domain of the 3d image {\bf in.pgm} form the domain of the 2d image {\bf out.pgm} . The grayscale values of {\bf out.pgm} are obtained by trilinear interpolation from the grayscale values of {\bf in.pgm} . The coordinates of the basis for the plane are expressed in \char`\"{}real world\char`\"{} dimensions.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 3d, int32\_\-t 3d

{\bf Category:} geo
