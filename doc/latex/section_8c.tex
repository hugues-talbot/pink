computes a 2d cross section from a 3d image  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
computes a 2d cross section from a 3d image {\bfseries Usage:} section in.pgm x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} The points P0 ( {\bfseries x0}, {\bfseries y0}, {\bfseries z0} ), P1 ( {\bfseries x1}, {\bfseries y1}, {\bfseries z1} ) and P2 ( {\bfseries x2}, {\bfseries y2}, {\bfseries z2} ) form a basis for a plane in the 3d space. The intersection of this plane with the domain of the 3d image {\bfseries in.pgm} form the domain of the 2d image {\bfseries out.pgm} . The grayscale values of {\bfseries out.pgm} are obtained by trilinear interpolation from the grayscale values of {\bfseries in.pgm} . The coordinates of the basis for the plane are expressed in \char`\"{}real world\char`\"{} dimensions.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 3d, int32\_\-t 3d

{\bfseries Category:} geo
