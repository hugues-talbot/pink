\subsection{Detailed Description}
topologically controled binary shrinking guided by a priority image 

{\bf Usage:} toposhrink in.pgm prio.pgm connex tmin tmax tbmin tbmax [inhibit] out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Topologically controled binary shrinking guided by a priority image. The lowest values of the priority image correspond to the highest priority.

The parameter {\bf prio} is an image (byte or int32\_\-t).

The parameter {\bf connex} indicates the connectivity of the binary object. Possible choices are 4, 8 in 2D and 6, 18, 26 in 3D.

If the parameter {\bf inhibit} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image (set Y) will be left unchanged.

Let X be the set of points of the binary image {\bf in.pgm} .



\begin{footnotesize}\begin{verbatim}
Repeat until stability: 
    select a point p of X \ Y such that
        tmin <= T(p) <= tmax and tbmin <= Tb(p) <= tbmax 
        and with the lowest possible priority value
    X := X \ { p }
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}


{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bf Category:} topobin
