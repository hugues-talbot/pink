convex hull of a set of points in the 2D plane  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
convex hull of a set of points in the 2D plane {\bfseries Usage:} convewhull in.pgm mode out

{\bfseries Description:} Computes the convex hull of the set of non-\/null points in the image {\bfseries in.pgm}, by the Jarvis's algorithm as described in \char`\"{}Introduction to algorithms\char`\"{}, T. Cormen, C. Leiserson, R. Rivest, MIT Press.

The parameter {\bfseries mode} selects the format of the result: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0: list of the support points of the convex hull \item 1: support points of the convex hull, embedded in the image frame \item 2: contour of the convex hull, embedded in the image frame \item 3: full convex hull, embedded in the image frame\end{DoxyItemize}
{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2D

{\bfseries Category:} geo
