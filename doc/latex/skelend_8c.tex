homotopic skeleton of a 2d or 3d binary image with dynamic detection of end points  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
homotopic skeleton of a 2d or 3d binary image with dynamic detection of end points {\bfseries Usage:} skelend in.pgm connex [n] out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Homotopic skeletonization by iterative removal of simple, non-\/end points. Breadth-\/first strategy. During the first {\bfseries n} iterations (default 0), the end points are removed as well. If {\bfseries n} = -\/1, the end points are always removed.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} topobin
