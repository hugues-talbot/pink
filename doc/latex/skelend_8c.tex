\subsection{Detailed Description}
homotopic skeleton of a 2d or 3d binary image with dynamic detection of end points 

{\bf Usage:} skelend in.pgm connex [n] out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Homotopic skeletonization by iterative removal of simple, non-end points. Breadth-first strategy. During the first {\bf n} iterations (default 0), the end points are removed as well. If {\bf n} = -1, the end points are always removed.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bf Category:} topobin
