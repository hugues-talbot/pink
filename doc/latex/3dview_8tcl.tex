interactive visualization / segmentation of a 3D image 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
interactive visualization / segmentation of a 3D image 

{\bf Usage:} \doxyref{3dview.tcl}{p.}{3dview_8tcl} in.pgm out.pgm [mark.pgm]\par
 3dview in.pgm out.pgm [mark.pgm]

{\bf Description:}

Displays three cross sections of a 3D grayscale image, and allows for simple segmentation by thresholding. If given, the parameter {\bf mark.pgm} must be a binary image (to be superimposed with the input image {\bf in.pgm}). Segmentation result is saved in {\bf out.pgm}.

Menus: \begin{itemize}
\item File: choose {\bf Quit} to save and exit. \item Analyze: to compute the histogram of the full image (item {\bf Histogram}) or of the Region Of Interest specified by the current segmentation (item {\bf ROI} Histogram). \item Threshold: simple of double thresholding. \item Visualize: choose {\bf Revert} to inverse the gray levels, check {\bf Surimp} to superimpose the binary image to the grayscale data, check {\bf Light} for superimposition to be made with a light color, choose {\bf Render} or {\bf Rendersmooth} to launch a 3D rendering of the binary image (a smoothing of the surface is done with the last choice).\end{itemize}
{\bf Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bf Category:} inter
