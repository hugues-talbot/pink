Pink can be compiled with two sets of tools. For the compilation with dependency checking and Python front-\/end, visit the page \doxyref{Compiling Pink with CMake}{p.}{compiling_cmake}. For the classical compilation look at \doxyref{Compiling Pink with make}{p.}{compiling_make}. You can also compile Pink on windows (including the Python front-\/end). For details on compiling on windows look at \doxyref{Compiling Pink on Microsoft Windows}{p.}{compiling_windows}.\section{Development}\label{index_development}
For developing Pink look at the \doxyref{Conventions for developing Pink operators}{p.}{dev_conventions} page. For exporting functions in Python look at the \doxyref{Exporting functions to Python}{p.}{python_export} page.\section{Dependencies}\label{index_dependencies}
For optimal use, the following packages should be installed: \par
\par
 {\tt Python}\par
 {\tt Doxygen}\par
 {\tt ActiveTcl 8.3}\par
 {\tt VTK}\par
