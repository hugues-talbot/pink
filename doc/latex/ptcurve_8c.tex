\subsection{Detailed Description}
detects curve points in a binary image {\bfseries Usage:} ptcurve in.pgm connex out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} An curve point is a white point, which has exactly 2 white n-\/neighbours that are not n-\/neighbours to each other. In other words, Tn = 2 and each neighboring n-\/connected component is made of exactly one point (n = 4, 8 (2d) or 6, 18, 26 (3d), as set by the parameter {\bfseries connex})
