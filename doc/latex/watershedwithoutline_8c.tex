watershed transformation without line of separation 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
watershed transformation without line of separation 

{\bf Usage:} watershedwithoutline in mark $<$bgmark$|$null$>$ $<$roi$|$null$>$ connex out

{\bf Description:} Performs the watershed transformation on the image {\bf in}, taking the set of markers in {\bf mark}. If this parameter is present, {\bf bgmark} is used as a set of markers for the background. If this parameter is present, {\bf roi} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. The parameter {\bf connex} gives the adjacency relation (4,8 in 2D; 6,18,26 in 3D) for the makers.

The image out is a label image (int32\_\-t)

This version does not create any line to separate the catchment basins.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bf Category:} connect
