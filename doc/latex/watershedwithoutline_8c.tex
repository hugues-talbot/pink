If this parameter is present, {\bfseries bgmark} is used as a set of markers for the background. If this parameter is present, {\bfseries roi} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. The parameter {\bfseries connex} gives the adjacency relation (4,8 in 2D; 6,18,26 in 3D) for the makers.

The image out is a label image (int32\_\-t)

This version does not create any line to separate the catchment basins.
