rotation of an image  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
rotation of an image {\bfseries Usage:} rotatebin in.pgm theta [x y] out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} rotates the image {\bfseries in.pgm} of the angle {\bfseries theta} (in degrees). Method: truncated real rotation. If {\bfseries x} and {\bfseries y} are given, then the center of the rotation is the point (x,y) and the image size is left unchanged (hence parts of object may be lost). Otherwise, the center of the rotation is the point (0,0) and the resulting image size is computed such that no loss of information occur.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bfseries Category:} geo
