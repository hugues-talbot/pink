Thin watershed transformation (Meyer's algorithm on perfect fusion grid).  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Thin watershed transformation (Meyer's algorithm on perfect fusion grid). {\bfseries Usage:} watershedthin in mark $<$bgmark$|$null$>$ $<$roi$|$null$>$ parite out

{\bfseries Description:}

Performs the watershed transformation on the image {\bfseries in}, considered to be on a perfect fusion grid, taking the set of markers in {\bfseries mark}. Returns the divide set.

If this parameter is present, {\bfseries bgmark} is used as a set of markers for the background. If this parameter is present, {\bfseries roi} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. The parameter {\bfseries parite} (0 or 1) gives the the translation of the fusion grid.

{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bfseries Category:} connect
