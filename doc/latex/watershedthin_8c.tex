Thin watershed transformation (Meyer's algorithm on perfect fusion grid). 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Thin watershed transformation (Meyer's algorithm on perfect fusion grid). 

{\bf Usage:} watershedthin in mark $<$bgmark$|$null$>$ $<$roi$|$null$>$ parite out

{\bf Description:}

Performs the watershed transformation on the image {\bf in}, considered to be on a perfect fusion grid, taking the set of markers in {\bf mark}. Returns the divide set.

If this parameter is present, {\bf bgmark} is used as a set of markers for the background. If this parameter is present, {\bf roi} indicates the region of interest on which the operation is performed. The parameter {\bf parite} (0 or 1) gives the the translation of the fusion grid.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 2d

{\bf Category:} connect
