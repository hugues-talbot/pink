topologically controled grayscale shrinking (one step)  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
topologically controled grayscale shrinking (one step) {\bfseries Usage:} toposhrinkgray in.pgm connex t+min t+max t-\/-\/min t-\/-\/max $<$0$|$a$|$d$>$ [inhibit] out.pgm

{\bfseries Description:} Topologically controled grayscale shrinking (one step).

The parameter $<$0$|$a$|$d$>$ indicates the action performed on the selected point p: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0: it is lowered down to 0; \item a: it is lowered down to alpha-\/(p,F) where F denotes the original image; \item d: it is lowered down to delta-\/(p,F) where F denotes the original image.\end{DoxyItemize}
The parameter {\bfseries connex} indicates the connectivity of the binary object. Possible choices are 4, 8 in 2D and 6, 18, 26 in 3D.

If the parameter {\bfseries inhibit} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image (set Y) will be left unchanged.

\begin{DoxyVerb}
  For all points p, not in Y, and such that 
      t+min <= T+(p) <= t+max and t--min <= T--(p) <= t--max 
    lower p according to the chosen strategy
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries Types supported:} byte 2d, byte 3d

{\bfseries Category:} topogray
